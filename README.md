# dotfiles

Configs for zsh/bash/fish, git, tmux, bspwm, i3, awesome, and vim, plus some handy aliases.

## Installation
An install.sh script is provided to allow the user to choose what to install and automate the installation. Ubuntu 16.04 is assumed.

## Aliases
system_aliases is compatible with zsh, bash, and fish shells. Features handy aliases for commands like ls, cd, emacs, apt-get, and git. Why `cd ..` when you can `..` instead?

## bspwm
![bspwm](/../master/screenshots/bspwm.png?raw=true)
I'm currently using [bspwm](https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm) as my tiling window manager of choice, using [polybar](https://github.com/jaagr/polybar) for displaying CPU, RAM, disk space, battery life, and time. To install the custom bspwm badge (modified mirror image of awesome), copy custom_bspwm_badge.png to /usr/share/unity-greeter. Keybindings configured in sxhkdrc are mostly the same as the i3 equivalents below.

## i3 (no longer maintained, see bspwm above)
![glowfish](/../master/screenshots/glowfish.png?raw=true)
Glowfish is a custom i3wm theme with conky and rofi, representing my best efforts to "de-uglify" i3. It is semi-inspired by the [daylerees](https://github.com/daylerees/colour-schemes) glowfish theme and copies the [awesome copycats](https://github.com/copycat-killer/awesome-copycats) multicolor theme bar colors. Glowfish features CPU, RAM, disk usage, battery, weather, and date/time, using glyphs supplied by Siji font. All common commands are designed to be issued with two keys (mod4 + a letter). Some features are still in progress. Requires rofi, conky, and tamsyn and [Siji](https://github.com/gstk/siji) fonts to be installed, as well as Droid Sans Mono for Powerline.

For displaying weather on Debian/Ubuntu, run `sudo apt-get install weather-utils` and add the line `id = <your_zipcode>` to /etc/weatherrc.

## Tmux
Features extremely quick pane and window spawn/kill/switching, using ctrl-arrows and shift-arrows, respectively. The prefix key is set to C-t, in order to reduce friction with emacs. Requires tmux 1.9 and the [tmux plugin manager](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm) in order to support tmux-resurrect and tmux-yank plugins (but you can disable them, if desired).

Keybinding         | Description
-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------
<kbd>C-t t</kbd>   | Change to last-window by pressing Ctrl-t, letting go, and pressing t again.
<kbd>C-tt...</kbd> | By holding down Ctrl and pressing t repeatedly, you can cycle through panes with this chained command.
<kbd>S-up</kbd>    | Create new-window.
<kbd>S-down</kbd>  | Kill window.
<kbd>S-left</kbd>  | Previous window.
<kbd>S-right</kbd> | Next window.
<kbd>C-up</kbd>    | Select pane above.
<kbd>C-down</kbd>  | Select pane below.

<kbd>C-t ,</kbd>   | Rename current window.
<kbd>C-t r</kbd>   | Reload the .tmux.conf file.

## Zsh
My zsh configuration uses [antigen](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen) for package management and [agnoster](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/Themes#agnoster) as the prompt, which requires a powerline-patched font. Install the former to a `~/.antigen` folder. Completion functions are provided through zprezto modules, and zaw is included for helm-like history search with `C-r`. Clone the [zaw](https://github.com/zsh-users/zaw) repo to `~/.zaw`.

## Miscellaneous Thoughts
* After trying xmonad and awesome, I found that while I enjoyed the power of tiling window managers, I had no earthly idea what to do when they broke, which they did often and horribly. The amount of time spent fixing them was just not commensurate to the amount of functionality I was gaining. Then I found i3, a tiling window manager configurable in plain English, which instantly prints out the location of any errors when you load it. It's probably one of the best tiling window managers out there in terms of readability. Most recently, I switched to bspwm, which is more terse, but simple to configure as well.
